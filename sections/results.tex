\section{Results}
\label{ch:Results}

In this chapter, the results of the forecasting challenge are discussed. First, in \cref{sec:Results:ComparisonModels} a comparison of the models is done on the internal validation scheme that was employed throughout the project to select models. Second, in \cref{sec:Results:Backtest} a backtest of the thirteen submission weeks is done to evaluate how models would have performed during the challenge.
