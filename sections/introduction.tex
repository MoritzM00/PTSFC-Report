\section{Introduction}
\label{ch:Introduction}

Forecasting is an integral part of modern data science, with applications ranging from energy management to urban planning. Among these, probabilistic forecasting offers a robust framework for understanding and quantifying uncertainty, making it particularly relevant for dynamic systems like (electrical) energy demand and urban bike traffic. Unlike traditional deterministic approaches, quantile forecasts provide point predictions and prediction intervals, which are vital for decision-making under uncertainty. For instance, a 95\% central prediction interval defined by the 2.5\% and 97.5\% quantiles provides reliable energy demand forecasts that can help optimize grid operations and reduce costs, while accurate bike count predictions improve city planning and public transportation efficiency.

This report generates probabilistic forecasts using traditional tabular regression models, specifically Gradient-Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithms like XGBoost \parencite{chen_xgboost_2016} and LightGBM \parencite{ke_lightgbm_2017}. These tree-based models are evaluated against simpler benchmark models, including a historical quantile-based approach and linear quantile regression. The aim is to systematically assess the strengths and limitations of different GBDT implementations for probabilistic forecasting tasks.

The evaluation framework employs time-series cross-validation to ensure robustness across various temporal contexts. The Pinball Loss, a standard metric for assessing quantile forecasts, serves as the primary evaluation criterion. However, in the context of probabilistic forecasting, it is important to assess model calibration in addition to the relative evaluation metrics. A calibration plot provides visual insight, and empirical coverages can be used to assess prediction intervals.
In addition to numerical metrics, visual inspections of forecast distributions and analyses of feature importance provide qualitative insights into model behavior and explanatory power.

This study examines the models using two datasets, called \textit{targets}: 1) The \textit{Energy Target} which is Germany's hourly electrical energy consumption \parencite{noauthor_smard_2025} as reported by the German Bundesnetzagentur and 2) the \textit{Bike Target} which corresponds to daily bike counts in one specific road in the center of Karlsruhe. Both targets exhibit significant seasonality and the use of Feature Engineering is promising, thus motivating the adaptation of tabular regressors for the Timeseries application.
