\subsection{Hourly Electrical Energy Consumption in Germany}
\label{sec:Data:EnergyConsumption}

This data set provided by the German Bundesnetzagentur collects the hourly energy consumption of consumers in Germany \parencite{noauthor_smard_nodate}. When referring to energy, only electrical energy is meant that is currently taken from the grid. Figure XXX shows the consumption from 2022 to 2024(TODO)
