	abstract = {This paper explores the use of {XGBoost} for composite quantile regression. {XGBoost} is a highly popular model renowned for its flexibility, efficiency, and capability to deal with missing data. The optimization uses a second order approximation of the loss function, complicating the use of loss functions with a zero or vanishing second derivative. Quantile regression -- a popular approach to obtain conditional quantiles when point estimates alone are insufficient -- unfortunately uses such a loss function, the pinball loss. Existing workarounds are typically inefficient and can result in severe quantile crossings. In this paper, we present a smooth approximation of the pinball loss, the arctan pinball loss, that is tailored to the needs of {XGBoost}. Specifically, contrary to other smooth approximations, the arctan pinball loss has a relatively large second derivative, which makes it more suitable to use in the second order approximation. Using this loss function enables the simultaneous prediction of multiple quantiles, which is more efficient and results in far fewer quantile crossings.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The economic growth of every nation is highly related to its electricity infrastructure, network, and availability since electricity has become the central part of everyday life in this modern world. Hence, the global demand for electricity for residential and commercial purposes has seen an incredible increase. On the other side, electricity prices keep fluctuating over the past years and not mentioning the inadequacy in electricity generation to meet global demand. As a solution to this, numerous studies aimed at estimating future electrical energy demand for residential and commercial purposes to enable electricity generators, distributors, and suppliers to plan effectively ahead and promote energy conservation among the users. Notwithstanding, load forecasting is one of the major problems facing the power industry since the inception of electric power. The current study tried to undertake a systematic and critical review of about seventy-seven (77) relevant previous works reported in academic journals over nine years (2010–2020) in electricity demand forecasting. Specifically, attention was given to the following themes: (i) The forecasting algorithms used and their fitting ability in this field, (ii) the theories and factors affecting electricity consumption and the origin of research work, (iii) the relevant accuracy and error metrics applied in electricity load forecasting, and (iv) the forecasting period. The results revealed that 90\% out of the top nine models used in electricity forecasting was artificial intelligence based, with artificial neural network ({ANN}) representing 28\%. In this scope, {ANN} models were primarily used for short-term electricity forecasting where electrical energy consumption patterns are complicated. Concerning the accuracy metrics used, it was observed that root-mean-square error ({RMSE}) (38\%) was the most used error metric among electricity forecasters, followed by mean absolute percentage error {MAPE} (35\%). The study further revealed that 50\% of electricity demand forecasting was based on weather and economic parameters, 8.33\% on household lifestyle, 38.33\% on historical energy consumption, and 3.33\% on stock indices. Finally, we recap the challenges and opportunities for further research in electricity load forecasting locally and globally.},

	abstract = {Summary
            Probabilistic forecasts of continuous variables take the form of predictive densities or predictive cumulative distribution functions. We propose a diagnostic approach to the evaluation of predictive performance that is based on the paradigm of maximizing the sharpness of the predictive distributions subject to calibration. Calibration refers to the statistical consistency between the distributional forecasts and the observations and is a joint property of the predictions and the events that materialize. Sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions and is a property of the forecasts only. A simple theoretical framework allows us to distinguish between probabilistic calibration, exceedance calibration and marginal calibration. We propose and study tools for checking calibration and sharpness, among them the probability integral transform histogram, marginal calibration plots, the sharpness diagram and proper scoring rules. The diagnostic approach is illustrated by an assessment and ranking of probabilistic forecasts of wind speed at the Stateline wind energy centre in the {US} Pacific Northwest. In combination with cross-validation or in the time series context, our proposal provides very general, nonparametric alternatives to the use of information criteria for model diagnostics and model selection.},

The modal interval also is elicitable, with a sole consistent scoring function, up to equivalence.

	abstract = {Important The underlying Open-Meteo file format has been upgraded to support future features. This change impacts only users of the open-data distribution on {AWS} and does not affect those using the {API} or running downloaders directly.

With this update, the {API} can now read both legacy and new file formats. Currently, only legacy files are available on {AWS}, but starting January 14, 2025, files in the new {OM} format will also be published on {AWS}. Users of the {AWS} distribution must upgrade their Docker images to version 1.4.0 or later.

The new Open-Meteo file format is designed to be more flexible and compatible with standards, similar to formats like {NetCDF}4 or {HDF}5. We are working on client libraries that will allow users to access curated Open-Meteo weather data directly from {AWS} S3, enabling data scientists to analyze data at large scales, such as entire countries or continents, without interacting with the {API} for individual data pieces.

This release marks the first step toward this vision, preparing Docker image users for the new file formats. Development of Python, Rust, and {TypeScript} libraries is ongoing and will take some time to complete.

	abstract = {🎉🎉🎉 Exciting News! The Open-Meteo source code has officially reached version 1.0.0, marking a significant milestone. This release introduces a stable distribution for both Docker and Ubuntu packages, ensuring a more seamless and reliable deployment experience! 🎉🎉🎉

Major changes include a restructuring of the internal database layout and the incorporation of new weather models. The redesigned database layout is geared towards long-term stability, ensuring compatibility with future versions.

‼️ Important Notice: For users upgrading from previous versions utilizing Docker or Ubuntu Prebuilt packages, it is important to execute a database migration script to preserve previously downloaded weather data. Additionally, many weather models and variables have undergone renaming for consistency. Refer to this {PR} for detailed information. ‼️

Version 1.0.0 also establishes the groundwork for redistributing the Open-Meteo database as open-data through an {AWS} Open-Data Sponsorship. Instead of directly downloading raw weather data in {GRIB} format from national weather services, users can now access the optimized time-series database from Open-Meteo directly through {AWS}. The open-data distribution allows fine control, enabling users to retrieve only a specific subset of weather variables relevant to their use case. This not only conserves resources for data processing but also reduces bandwidth usage on the servers of national weather services. Instructions can be found in the getting started guide and the open-data documentation. Please be aware that not all weather models and data sources are currently available and will be progressively added over the next few weeks with documentation and examples to follow.

We sincerely appreciate your continuous support and trust that you'll find immense value in the latest enhancements introduced to the Open-Meteo weather {API}!

About the Open-Meteo Weather {API}: Open-Meteo is a weather {API} that operates on an open-source basis and provides free access for non-commercial purposes. No {API} key is necessary; you can start using it right away!

At Open-Meteo, we firmly believe that access to accurate and dependable weather data should be accessible to all. That's why we've developed an open-source weather {API} that utilizes weather forecasts derived from open-data sources offered by national weather services. Unlike other weather {APIs}, Open-Meteo grants complete access to its source code, and all data sources are openly acknowledged, giving credit to the national weather services for their valuable contributions. Users can set up their own weather {API} rapidly using Docker or prebuilt Ubuntu packages. By sharing the source code, users can thoroughly scrutinize the weather data processing and even make adjustments as needed. We actively encourage and welcome contributions from our user community.

This {API} is freely available for non-commercial use, with no associated costs. Despite being free of charge, it delivers top-tier forecast accuracy. Leveraging an extensive range of local weather models with frequent updates, the {API} ensures the generation of highly precise forecasts for locations worldwide.

We appreciate your consideration of Open-Meteo for your weather data requirements. We are continuously working to enhance our services and are open to any feedback or inquiries you may have. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us at info@open-meteo.com.},

The hourly load data are log transformed and split into a long-term trend component and a remainder term. The key forecasting element is the quantile regression approach for the remainder term, which takes into account both weekly and annual seasonalities, such as their interactions. Temperature information is used only for stabilizing the forecast of the long-term trend component. Information on public holidays is ignored. However, the forecasting method still placed second in the open data track and fourth in the definite data track, which is remarkable given the simplicity of the model. The method also outperforms the Vanilla benchmark consistently.},

To do so, the competition required the prediction of nine different quantiles (0.005, 0.025, 0.165, 0.250, 0.500, 0.750, 0.835, 0.975, and 0.995), that can sufficiently describe the complete distributions of future sales.

	abstract = {Heterogeneous tabular data are the most commonly used form of data and are essential for numerous critical and computationally demanding applications. On homogeneous data sets, deep neural networks have repeatedly shown excellent performance and have therefore been widely adopted. However, their adaptation to tabular data for inference or data generation tasks remains challenging. To facilitate further progress in the field, this work provides an overview of state-of-the-art deep learning methods for tabular data. We categorize these methods into three groups: data transformations, specialized architectures, and regularization models. For each of these groups, our work offers a comprehensive overview of the main approaches. Moreover, we discuss deep learning approaches for generating tabular data, and we also provide an overview over strategies for explaining deep models on tabular data. Thus, our first contribution is to address the main research streams and existing methodologies in the mentioned areas, while highlighting relevant challenges and open research questions. Our second contribution is to provide an empirical comparison of traditional machine learning methods with eleven deep learning approaches across five popular real-world tabular data sets of different sizes and with different learning objectives. Our results, which we have made publicly available as competitive benchmarks, indicate that algorithms based on gradient-boosted tree ensembles still mostly outperform deep learning models on supervised learning tasks, suggesting that the research progress on competitive deep learning models for tabular data is stagnating. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth overview of deep learning approaches for tabular data; as such, this work can serve as a valuable starting point to guide researchers and practitioners interested in deep learning with tabular data.},

Tree ensemble models (such as {XGBoost}) are usually recommended for classification and regression problems with tabular data. However, several deep learning models for tabular data have recently been proposed, claiming to outperform {XGBoost} for some use cases. This paper explores whether these deep models should be a recommended option for tabular data by rigorously comparing the new deep models to {XGBoost} on various datasets. In addition to systematically comparing their performance, we consider the tuning and computation they require. Our study shows that {XGBoost} outperforms these deep models across the datasets, including the datasets used in the papers that proposed the deep models. We also demonstrate that {XGBoost} requires much less tuning. On the positive side, we show that an ensemble of deep models and {XGBoost} performs better on these datasets than {XGBoost} alone.},

We define a standard set of 45 datasets from varied domains with clear characteristics of tabular data and a benchmarking methodology accounting for both fitting models and finding good hyperparameters. Results show that tree-based models remain state-of-the-art on medium-sized data (\${\textbackslash}sim\$10K samples) even without accounting for their superior speed. To understand this gap, we conduct an empirical investigation into the differing inductive biases of tree-based models and Neural Networks ({NNs}). This leads to a series of challenges which should guide researchers aiming to build tabular-specific {NNs}: 1. be robust to uninformative features, 2. preserve the orientation of the data, and 3. be able to easily learn irregular functions. To stimulate research on tabular architectures, we contribute a standard benchmark and raw data for baselines: every point of a 20 000 compute hours hyperparameter search for each learner.},

            In the analysis of data it is often assumed that observations y  1, y  2, …, yn are independently normally distributed with constant variance and with expectations specified by a model linear in a set of parameters θ. In this paper we make the less restrictive assumption that such a normal, homoscedastic, linear model is appropriate after some suitable transformation has been applied to the y's. Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

Both techniques were created to fight a prediction shift caused by a special kind of target leakage present in all currently existing implementations of gradient boosting algorithms.

In order to prove our point, we will introduce Optuna, an optimization software which is a culmination of our effort in the development of a next generation optimization software.

	isbn = {978-1-5108-6096-4},

	shorttitle = {{LightGBM}},
	abstract = {Gradient Boosting Decision Tree ({GBDT}) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as {XGBoost} and {pGBRT}. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling ({GOSS}) and Exclusive Feature Bundling ({EFB}). With {GOSS}, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, {GOSS} can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With {EFB}, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is {NP}-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new {GBDT} implementation with {GOSS} and {EFB} {LightGBM}. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, {LightGBM} speeds up the training process of conventional {GBDT} by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.},

	abstract = {Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method. In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called {XGBoost}, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, {XGBoost} scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},
